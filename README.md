**Evidence-calibrated GPT-5.6 model and reasoning selection for OpenAI Codex.** Route each task segment to Sol, Terra, or Luna at the lowest sufficient reasoning effort—inside Codex, with no external API or API key.

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

## Why this tool?

GPT-5.6 adds three model tiers and several reasoning levels to Codex. This Skill turns that repeated choice into a bounded workflow: evaluate the current task, switch only at useful segment boundaries, and restore a verified original GPT-5.6 route when finished.

## Quick start

Send this in Codex:

```text
$skill-installer Install Codex Auto Model Router from https://github.com/orange-the-weak/codex-auto-model-router
```

Restart Codex afterward. To install all 24 optional custom-agent presets or migrate from the old name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orange-the-weak/codex-auto-model-router.git
cd codex-auto-model-router
./install.sh
```

## Evidence-backed routing

The current policy is calibrated from OpenAI coding results, the independent Artificial Analysis Coding Agent Index, and the DeepSWE, Terminal-Bench, and SWE-Bench Pro methodologies. API per-effort measurements inform only relative capability, latency, and output growth; they are not treated as Codex wall time or subscription cost.

| Route | Default use |
|---|---|
| **Luna low** | Clear mechanical edits and deterministic checks |
| **Luna medium** | Large repetitive batches |
| **Terra low** | Bounded ordinary work with deterministic verification |
| **Terra medium** | Ordinary work with interacting files or constraints |
| **Sol medium** | Bounded complex work |
| **Sol high** | High ambiguity, coupling, judgment, or consequence |
| **Sol xhigh** | A failed complex attempt, or explicit user choice |

Task evidence and user overrides always win. The benchmark snapshot is versioned, offline, and valid for 90 days; missing, invalid, or stale evidence falls back to deterministic rules without blocking work. See the [full evidence report](references/benchmark-evidence.md) and [machine-readable snapshot](references/benchmark-evidence.json).

For an illustrative mixed workload, the current policy estimates **15–30% faster AI-work turnaround** than using Sol/medium everywhere. This is a conservative hypothesis—not a universal Codex benchmark—and should be refined from local usage history.

## How it works

- Re-evaluates every applicable request instead of inheriting the previous route.
- Keeps simple work in one segment; splits analysis, implementation, verification, or review only when different routes materially help.
- Uses a standard 4-segment/4-switch budget, adaptive 6/6 for genuinely complex or large plans, and an explicit hard limit of 8/8. Restore counts as a switch.
- Keeps fallback inside GPT-5.6: Sol tries Terra then Luna; Terra tries Sol then Luna; Luna tries Terra then Sol. GPT-5.5 is allowed only when the complete 5.6 family is unavailable.
- Announces the selected model and reasoning once per segment, stops on failure, and restores a verified original GPT-5.6 route once.
- Records only verified execution in a local JSONL ledger; recommendations never count as observed use.

## Use

```text
$codex-auto-model-router Analyze this repository and recommend routes.
$codex-auto-model-router Implement this feature with dynamic segment routing.
$codex-auto-model-router Use GPT-5.6 Terra high for this task.
$codex-auto-model-router Query usage ratios and retune from observed outcomes.
```

Example notice:

```text
Codex automatic routing | Segment 1/3: Analyze the change | Model: GPT-5.6 Sol | Reasoning: high | High ambiguity
```

Reports are written to `docs/codex-model-routing-report.md`; verified usage is stored in `.codex/model-routing-history.jsonl`. The ledger contains routing metadata and outcomes, not prompts, source code, secrets, or conversation text.

## A personal note

This is my first open-source project. I built it after spending too much time making the same model-choice decision across Codex projects. Practical feedback, issue reports, and small improvements are very welcome.

## Compatibility and development

This project requires Codex with personal Skill support. Same-task overrides and custom agents depend on the active surface. While any GPT-5.6 route is selectable, the Skill neither falls back nor restores to GPT-5.5 or an ambiguous `available-default`. If a task starts on 5.5 and successfully enters 5.6, it stays on the verified 5.6 route. A 5.5 fallback is recorded and shown only when Sol, Terra, and Luna are all unavailable.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 tests/validate_distribution.py
```
